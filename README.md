# Dynamic Logging with Ammonite

This is an [Ammonite](http://ammonite.io/) script that demonstrates how you can 
use [Echopraxia](com/tersesystems/echopraxia-plusscala) to control logging 
dynamically while the script is running.

To run, install Ammonite and then `amm script.sc` will print logs to console.

Then edit `tweakflow.tf` while the program is running to see output either on or off.
